		    <p>Hi, I'm</p>
		    <h1>Jonathan!</h1>

		    <h1>Introduction</h1>

		    <p>Currently I work at Walk Stock Farm, Inc. which is a family company that focuses on grain and hog production.  Here I wear many hats doing the jobs of a financial analyst, IT/technical support, and chief research officer.</p>

		    <p>I took this job primarily to provide me an income while I enhance my skill base and determine what exactly I'd like to do with the rest of my life (or at least a fair chunk of it).  Consequently, I've been dabbling in statistics and programming which is why I'm taking this course.</p>

		    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
