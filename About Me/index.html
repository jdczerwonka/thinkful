			<p>Hi I'm</p>
			<h1>Jonathan</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Currently I work at Walk Stock Farm, Inc. which is a family company that focuses on grain and hog production.  Here I wear many hats doing the jobs of a financial analyst, IT/technical support, and chief research officer.</p>

			<p>I took this job primarily to provide me an income while I enhance my skill base and determine what exactly I'd like to do with the rest of my life (or at least a fair chunk of it).  Consequently, I've been dabbling in statistics and programming which is why I'm taking this course.</p>

			<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
			<p>I am of thoroughly Midwestern origins.  My parents are from small towns near Effingham, IL, I was born in Louisville, KY, spent my early life in Cedar Rapids, IA, high school in the Chicago suburbs, and college at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</p>
